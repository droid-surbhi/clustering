    "# Incremental agglomerative clustering\n",
    "Incremental agglomerative clustering, given old clusters, maps new data to old clusters and creates new clusters for unmapped records. It is a bottom-up approach, meaning it assumes all the data points belong to separate clusters initially. Then it recursively merges the cluster pairs which have minimum distance between them. This kind of approach is useful when we are dealing with temporal text data and need to cluster it incrementally in time. For example, news, social media posts, chats etc. which keep on increasing with time and there is no endpoint to wait for before doing the analysis. This implementation is based on the following paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "* X. Dai, Q. Chen, X. Wang and J. Xu, \"Online topic detection and tracking of financial news based on hierarchical clustering,\" 2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 2010, pp. 3341-3346, doi: 10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580677.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "•\tConsiders set of records, does tf-idf vectorization -> agglomerative hierarchical clustering (sklearn) -> for next interval, update tf-idf vectorizer-> use clusters identified in just previous interval as candidate clusters, perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering on new data -> map/merge new clusters with candidate clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to identify topics for new set of stories, given some candidate topics as previous set of stories and corresponding topic: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the set of candidate clusters CTS from previous set.\n",
    "2. Get the set of new clusters in new set using agglomerative clustering (sklearn).\n",
    "3. Get a cluster Tc from the new set NTC, and calculate the similarity between Tc and each single cluster ct within the old set CTS. If the maximum similarity, which is the similarity between ct and Tc, is not smaller than the threshold θ, we consider that ct is related to Tc.\n",
    "4. Combine the cluster Tc into the previous cluster ct, and rebuild the cluster model.\n",
    "5. Delete Tc from NTC, repeat from step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use this clustering method by running an example with kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset). This is a news category dataset with date information along with headline and short description. We have shown clustering over headlines only, dataset being sorted according to date."
